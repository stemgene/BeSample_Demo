Besample is facing challenges with bot attacks. Our objectives are to identify key features that distinguish real users from bot users and to identify bot users as accurately as possible.

My Methodology for this project is based on the assumption that fraudulent users will participate in the business as much as possible to maximize their fraudulent profits. 
Additionally, they will fill out surveys by automated methods to minimize their time and effort costs.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53062c8c-476c-4c5e-9f9b-57c91be8d300)
